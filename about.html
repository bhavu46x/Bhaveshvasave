Video editing and creating animations have also captured my interest—especially with my YouTube cartoon channel that I’ve created. It's a space where I can blend art and technology, telling stories through visuals. PUBG is a game I enjoy playing to unwind, but it's not just about the game—it’s about strategy, teamwork, and quick thinking, which I find exciting and challenging.</p>
